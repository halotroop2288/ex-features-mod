# Ex-Features Mod

This mod re-adds all the cool features from the cutting room floor of Minecraft's development.<br/>
It also ports over features that never made it into the Java Edition of the game, but were/are found in other versions.<br/>
It utilizes Fabric to keep the mod up to date much quicker. <br/>
[Indev World Gen](https://github.com/Amb0s/indev-world-gen) shares very similar goals to this mod,
so to avoid doubling the amount of work we both have to do, it will be prepackaged inside this one 
(via [JAR nesting](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/documentation:fabric_loader#nested_jars)).<br/>
Since there's only so many IDs for terrain gen types, and that mod takes up quite a few of them, I also plan to be compatible with 
[Simplex Terrain](https://github.com/SuperCoder7979/simplexterrain) and promise nothing else until the issue with limited IDs is solved.
