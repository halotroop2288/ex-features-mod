# Ex-Features Mod

This mod re-adds all the cool features from the cutting room floor of Minecraft's development.<br/>
It also ports over features that never made it into the Java Edition of the game, but were/are found in other versions.<br/>
It utilizes Fabric to keep the mod up to date much quicker. <br/>
As of pre-release version 0.2.0, [Indev World Gen](https://github.com/Amb0s/indev-world-gen) will not be prepackaged inside this mod.
Instead, I will be rewriting it inside this mod around the release of version 1.0.x. Development of IWG was not going smoothly for me,
and according to one comment by the one of the original mod authors, that mod uses some outdated code. (Which became pretty clear while working with it.)<br/>
Since there's only so many IDs for terrain gen types, and that mod takes up quite a few of them, I also plan to be compatible with 
[Simplex Terrain](https://github.com/SuperCoder7979/simplexterrain) and promise nothing else until the issue with limited IDs is solved.
