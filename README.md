# Ex-Features Mod

This mod re-adds all the cool features from the cutting room floor of Minecraft's development.<br/>
It also ports over features that never made it into the Java Edition of the game, but were/are found in other versions.<br/>
It utilizes Fabric to keep the mod up to date much quicker. <br/>
As of pre-release version 0.2.0, [Indev World Gen](https://github.com/Amb0s/indev-world-gen) will not be prepackaged inside this mod.
Instead, I will be rewriting it inside this mod around the release of version 1.0.x. Development of IWG was not going smoothly for me.
