# Abandoned

The Fabric community doesn't seem very interested in a mod of this nature. Instead, members of the community continue to make many smaller mods that accomplish smaller parts of this mod's goal.
I will no longer be working on this mod. Feel free to fork it if you'd like to.

# Ex-Features Mod

This mod aims to re-add all the cool features from the cutting room floor of Minecraft's development, and port over features that never made it into the Java Edition of the game, but were/are found in other versions.<br/>
It utilizes Fabric Mod Loader to stay up to date and keep its codebase clean.
